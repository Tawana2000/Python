#Given the height and weight of a person, calculate the BMI and alert the user about what they should do next.
#BMI is a number that tells how fit the human body is. It depends on height and weight.  #Your program should print the given string if the BMI is less than 18.5 - Underweight
#18.5 to 24.9 - Normal Weight
#25.0 to 29.9 - Overweight
#30.0 or more - Obese
