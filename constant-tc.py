# If the execution time doesn't change by changing the input, is called constant time complexity (TC)

i = 5
print(i)

#so whatever value we assign to i, the number of statements to be executed is 2, so TC = O(2), it's general practice to write O(1) for all constant time complexity, so O(1) = O(100) = O(1070)...
